# InstaScope
InstaScope is a Flask-based web app that lets users log in with Instagram, scrape public profiles, and view or download images and descriptions in real time. It features per-user history, live progress updates, session-based access, and organizes all scraped data into user-specific folders for secure, personalized use.
